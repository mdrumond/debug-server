# Update Summary: Initial Debug/Test Server Specification

## Changes
- Added `.codex/spec.md` describing the server/client architecture, repository workflow, and debugging capabilities for the disaggregated debug/test platform.
- Seeded `.codex/environment.md` so future contributors can document the Docker/toolchain requirements once implementation starts.

## Notes
- No executable code was implemented per instructions; work is limited to project documentation/specification.
