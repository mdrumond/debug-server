# Spec Update – Open Questions Closed

- Documented that the previous "Open Questions / Next Steps" section in `.codex/spec.md` has been resolved and removed so the spec reflects final decisions instead of duplicating finished work.
- No additional implementation work was needed beyond keeping the spec concise and authoritative.

## Tests & Verification
- Ensured repository markdown remains consistent; see automated checks below for details.
